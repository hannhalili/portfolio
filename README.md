# Hann Azel Halili - Portfolio
## About Me
Hello! My name is Hann Azel Halili, and I am a passionate Information Technology student at Jose Rizal University. I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained throughout my studies and personal projects.

I specialize in software development with a focus on UI design, front-end development, and working with databases. I am skilled in UI design using tools like Figma and Wix, where I create interfaces and wireframes that are both user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, I have experience building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

In terms of databases, I am familiar with writing basic SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) and managing relational databases such as MySQL. For my development work, I frequently use Notepad++ as my text editor for coding and development tasks.

I am eager to further develop my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and I am always looking for opportunities to improve and expand my knowledge. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and best practices.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, and I would love to connect with you for future opportunities!
